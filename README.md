# EDA-Project
Exploratory Data Analysis using Python Script 
This project demonstrates basic exploratory data analysis using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## 🔍 Step - 1

To analyze a dataset using:
- Univariate analysis (histograms, boxplots)
- Bivariate analysis (scatter plots, boxplot with categories)
- Correlation matrix
- Countplots & Barplots for categorical features

### ✅ Step 2: Data Preprocessing & Model Building

- Cleaned data and performed label encoding
- Applied **Random Forest Classifier**
- Achieved **90% accuracy** on test dataset
- Evaluated using **confusion matrix** and **classification report**


## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📁 Project Structure
## 📌 Key Highlights

- Cleaned and explored both numerical and categorical features
- Visualized distributions, relationships, and correlations
- Created boxplots to identify outliers and groupwise analysis
- Used countplots for categorical variable distribution
- 2_Preprocessing_and_Model_Training.ipynb`: Data cleaning and model training
- `README.md`: Project summary and documentation
